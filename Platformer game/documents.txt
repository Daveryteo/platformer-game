The first extension I tried to make is to create platforms. Creating platforms meant that I
made platforms that allows the character to jump on or move around other than the ground.
In order to make the users use the platforms, I have placed collectables on some of them or
offer them to use platforms as alternatives of crossing the canyons instead of jumping over.
The part I found difficult about creating platforms was learning how to use the factory pattern.
As I had a hard time grasping the concept of methods, the factory pattern took me some time to understand
and adapt it to my code. From implementing this extension, it really made me research and understand
how to use the factory patterns in depth and how useful especially when we want to create multiple of the same object.

The second extension I tried to make is to create enemies. Creating enemies means that if
the player come into contact, they will lose a life. I managed to make use of platforms
to give them an alternative to avoid the enemies. However, I also made use of the way we
learnt how to draw collectables to give the users the ability to kill these enemies. In order
to incentivise them to kill the enemies as well, I gave them points if they managed to kill
the enemies. The part I found difficult about creating enemies was learning how to use constructor
functions. Since I had problems understanding methods, constructor functions also baffled me
when I was learning how to implement it. From implementing this extension, I learnt how to implement constructor
functions and learnt how versatile it is if we want to create multiple of the same object.
